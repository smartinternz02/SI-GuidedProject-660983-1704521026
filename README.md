Visualizing Sustainability:
A Cognos-Based Analysis Of Global Trends (2000-2023).

**Project Description:**
The Sustainable Development Report (SDR) reviews progress made
each year on the Sustainable Development Goals since their 
adoption by the 193 UN Member States in 2015. 
At the halfway mark to 2030, the Sustainable Development Report 
2023 takes stock of progress made and discusses priorities to restore and accelerate SDG progress.
Published on the eve of the 2023 Paris Summit for a New Global Financial Pact, 
this yearâ€™s edition focuses specifically on the need to scale up development finance 
and to reform the global financial architecture to support the SDGs.
